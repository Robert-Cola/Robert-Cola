I'm a Software Engineer with broader interests in philospohy and creative writing. I enjoy working on fun coding projects and learning about emerging and past technologies especially legacy languages.

Beyond tech I enjoy videogames and anime, but try to spend as much time being active or being outdoors as I spend behind a screen.
